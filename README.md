## CSS only

Bulma is a **CSS** framework. As such, the sole output is a single CSS file: [bulma.css](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/css/bulma.css)

You can either use that file, "out of the box", or download the Sass source files to customize the [variables](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/variables/).

There is **no** JavaScript included. People generally want to use their own JS implementation (and usually already have one). Bulma can be considered "environment agnostic": it's just the style layer on top of the logic.

## Browser Support

Bulma uses [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make (most) Flexbox features compatible with earlier browser versions. According to [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox), Bulma is compatible with **recent** versions of:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Opera
* Safari

Internet Explorer (10+) is only partially supported.

## Documentation

The documentation resides in the [docs](docs) directory, and is built with the Ruby-based [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) tool.
